                    <h1>I am a front-end developer based in Lagos Nigeria. </h1>
                    <p>Hi there! My name is Adedokun Farouq Adetunji. I am an aspiring full-stack engineer from Lagos, Nigeria. The fact that I could actually create something that can impact millions of people pushed me into this field and also the fact that I can actually solve world problems. 
                        I hope to build apps that not only work well but also look good.
                        I have interest in building technologies for other developers to use. Iâ€™m eager to meet and network with a lot of people, so feel free to connect with me!
                    </p>
